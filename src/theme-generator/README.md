# Theme Generator

- The theme generator helps create optimized CSS theme files from Figma designs.
- Utilize the [CSS Variable](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1270795391186145554/css-variables) Figma plugin to export CSS files for different themes and appearances.
- Link the generated files in the `themeGen.ts` file and execute it using Bun.
- The optimized theme files will be automatically added to the `src` directory.
